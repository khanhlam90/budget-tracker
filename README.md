## Description
MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data.

Giving users a fast and easy way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information at any time is even more important. Having offline functionality is paramount to the success of an application that handles usersâ€™ financial information.

this budget tracker application allows for offline access and functionality. The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. If the user enters transactions offline, the total should be updated when they're brought back online. At the end, this application is deployed to Heroku using MongdoDB Atlas.
